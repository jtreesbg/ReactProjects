# React & .NET Projects  

Welcome to my learning journey in React and .NET!  

## About  
This repository showcases a series of 10 projects designed to apply concepts I've learned through Udemy courses. Each project focuses on a unique React feature or tool, such as:  
- Hooks  
- Axios  
- Redux  
...and more!  

### Final Project: E-Album  
The series culminates in a comprehensive **E-Album** project for photo/card collection. This project combines all the mechanics and concepts explored in the earlier projects, providing a real-world application with rich functionality.
